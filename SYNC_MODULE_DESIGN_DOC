--------------DESIGN DOC - SYNC MODULE--------------
----------------------------------------------------

Purpose:
	Synchronizes state variable masters state 
	variable with slave elevators. Keeps all
	elevators up to date, fixing eventual
	desync problems. UDP loss etc...

Method:
	-Master broadcasts its state variable over UDP.
	 This is done by spamming update messages, demanding
	 confirmation from all elevators. This is for redundancy
	 so if the master dies it will not ruin the project.

	- Timeline
		Button pressed on elevator -> Sends UDP message to master
		-> Master synchronizes with other elevators
		-> Once all elevators ack, master designates task. This is then ack
		-> Master tells button-press-elevator to turn on light
